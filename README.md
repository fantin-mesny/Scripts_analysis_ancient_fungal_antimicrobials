## Scripts used for data analysis in the study '**Plant-associated fungi co-opt ancient antimicrobials for host manipulation**'.

### Antimicrobial activity predictor for fungal effector candidates (AMAPEC):
The AMAPEC software is available, together with the training dataset and the training pipeline at [github.com/fantin-mesny/amapec](https://github.com/fantin-mesny/amapec)

### Analysis of the secretomes of 3 phylogenetically distant fungi with distinct lifestyles:
- All data and analysis script in [Analysis of 3 secretomes](https://github.com/fantin-mesny/Scripts_analysis_ancient_fungal_antimicrobials/tree/main/Analysis%20of%203%20secretomes)

### Comparative genomics in a dataset of 150 fungal secretomes
- Secretomes and orthology prediction data in [Comparative genomics of 150 secretomes](https://github.com/fantin-mesny/Scripts_analysis_ancient_fungal_antimicrobials/tree/main/Comparative%20genomics%20of%20150%20fungal%20secretomes)
